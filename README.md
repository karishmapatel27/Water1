# Covid good 

In this challenge you'll build the product listing for covid goods and shopping cart pages.


## Setup

After cloning this repo

```
cd Water1  
npm i
npm run dev
```

Make sure you can go to [http://localhost:3000/designs/listing.html](http://localhost:3000/designs/listing.html) and see the page. Any change to the server will cause a restart and any change to client code will rebuild `bundle.js`.
